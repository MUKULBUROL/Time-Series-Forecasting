# Time Series Forecasting with AR and ODE Models
<br>
I have done this project under Prof. Lopa Mudra Giri in the APPLIED MATHEMATICS COURSE in my 3rd SEMESTER. As a part of the course we have done various assignments and class tutorials on MATLAB.
<br>
In this project we are a team of 3 people in which I have done AR Model part . <br>

> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:-
<br>
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for forecasting time series data using two different models:

> Autoregressive (AR) Model

> Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Model

**Overview-** <br>

The code provided demonstrates how to forecast time series data using both autoregressive and ODE models. The AR model is used for capturing and predicting temporal dependencies, while the ODE model is employed to model data with a continuous growth rate.


**Features:-** 
<br>

**AR Model**:
Splits data into training and testing sets.
Fits an AR model to the training data.
Forecasts future values and compares them with actual data.

**ODE Model**:
Defines and solves an ODE to model continuous growth.
Forecasts future values based on the growth rate.
